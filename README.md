# THIS IS THE FIRST ITERATION OF THE COUNTDOWN CLOCK
# USING RUBY FOR HOLT'S AWESOME COUNTDOWN CLOCK

## Some things to think about :
* We'll need to figure how to do things asynchronously
* When we put this onto the pi, we'll have to figure out how to
  run this program every minute or so

# TO RUN THE PROGRAM:
* cd into the directory
*  `ruby countdown_controller.rb` || `watch -n 60 ruby countdown_controller.rb`
